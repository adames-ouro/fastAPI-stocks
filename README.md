# fastAPI-stocks

## Description

This is an ongoing project to build a web site that fetches, displays, analyzes, and visualizes stock data (for now) using the yfinance API. Designed for learners and enthusiasts, the project covers various facets of development, including web serving with FastAPI, data manipulation with Pandas, and visualization with Dash and Plotly.

## Features

- **Automatic EMA Analysis**: Simple but effective automatic analysis on the spot
- **Data Visualization**: Interactive visualizations powered by Dash & Plotly to showcase stock trends
- **Responsive Web Design**: HTML and CSS-based frontend that's mobile-responsive


## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The backbone of the application; the initial version is mostly Python code using FastAPI.
- **HTML & CSS**: The building blocks of the web pages used in the python code.
